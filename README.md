# UniLink

UniLink is a project that aims to highlight how university students, although coming from different backgrounds, can feel part of one big community.

Through an intuitive WebApp with a user-friendly interface, students can find support for tutorials, collaborations with tutors or the creation of dynamic study groups.

Additional information regarding the structure and technologies used can be found within the "Documentation" folder and in the READMEs located in the subfolders.

Furthermore, in the GitLab Pages section, backend and frontend documentation can be consulted and read in full.
